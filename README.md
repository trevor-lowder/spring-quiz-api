Quiz API
=============================
### Summary of the API

This Quiz API contains 3 entities: `Quiz`, `Question`, and `Answer`. Each have an auto-generated numerical primary key. The `Quiz` entity has a name and maintains a collection of `Question` entities that are part of the the `Quiz` using an `@OneToMany` annotation, provided by JPA, to denote the relationship between the two tables in the database. The `Question` entity has a text field, the `Quiz` that it belongs to annotated with `@ManyToOne` representing the opposite side of the relationship stored in the `Quiz` class, and a collection of `Answer` objects annotated with `@OneToMany`. Finally, the `Answer` entity also has a text field, a boolean to denote if the given `Answer` is the correct one for the `Question` it belongs to, and the `Question` object that it belongs to annotated with `@ManyToOne`.

An entity relationship diagram is provided below that represents the database used by the Quiz API:
